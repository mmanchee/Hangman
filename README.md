## Description

a program to play the Hangman game.

<!-- Brainstorming
Make a program to play the Hangman game. Here's a refresher on the rules. Think carefully about the object(s) you'll use before starting. There are multiple ways to solve this problem.

The computer can generate the words from a pre-set list.
The user can make a Guess by entering a letter into a form. The app should tell them if it's right or wrong, and keep track of how many guesses they have left.
Don't worry about graphics. You can use a collection of 6 images. After the user has made a guess, take them to the /hangman page. If the user has one wrong guess, show the first image. If they have 2 wrong guesses, show the second image, etc.
On the /hangman page, display the letters they have guessed correctly so far, just like above: b _ b b _ _
Also, display the letters they have guessed incorrectly, and how many guesses they have left.
Make sure to display messages telling the user whether they've guessed correctly or incorrectly. Then a "Game Over" message if they're out of guesses.
Don't allow duplicate guesses. If the user tries to guess the same letter twice they should be told to try again.
Try to change the color of an element on your /hangman page based on whether the guess was right or wrong. Play around with changing the layout of your template file based on whether a guess is right or wrong, and whether or not the game is over.
Bonus: make it two-player! Create a new form page where one user can choose a word for the other user to guess.
